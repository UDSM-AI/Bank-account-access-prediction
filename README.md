# Bank Account Access Prediction
## Predicting Bank Account Access in East Africa with Machine Learning

**Motivation:**

Financial inclusion remains a critical challenge in East Africa, with only 14% of adults in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda having or using a bank account. Traditional methods for assessing financial inclusion have limitations, hindering effective interventions.

**Project Goal:**

Develop a machine learning model to predict bank account access across East Africa, providing data-driven insights to policymakers and financial institutions for targeted initiatives and product development.

**Technical Approach:**

* Utilize diverse machine learning algorithms on a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic, socioeconomic, financial access, and behavioral data.
* Implement feature engineering, cross-validation, and model tuning for optimal performance and generalizability.
* Ensure model explainability and interpretability to translate insights into actionable recommendations.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Improve bank account access prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.
* Identify key factors driving financial inclusion and exclusion in each East African country.
* Inform targeted financial inclusion initiatives and product development strategies.
* Contribute to increased bank account access and financial well-being in the region.

**Target Audience:**

* Policymakers and regulators in East Africa.
* Financial institutions operating in the region.
* Researchers and academics focused on financial inclusion.

**Next Steps:**

* Secure data access and partnerships with relevant stakeholders.
* Develop and refine the machine learning model.
* Analyze and interpret model findings.
* Disseminate insights and recommendations to policymakers and financial institutions.

**Join the Project:**

We encourage developers, data scientists, and financial inclusion experts to collaborate on this impactful initiative.
