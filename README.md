# Bank Account Access Prediction
## Predicting Bank Account Access in East Africa with Machine Learning

**Motivation:**

Financial inclusion remains a critical challenge in East Africa, with only 14% of adults in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda having or using a bank account. Traditional methods for assessing financial inclusion have limitations, hindering effective interventions.

**Project Goal:**

Develop a machine learning model to predict bank account access across East Africa, providing data-driven insights to policymakers and financial institutions for targeted initiatives and product development.

**Technical Approach:**

* Utilize diverse machine learning algorithms on a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic, socioeconomic, financial access, and behavioral data.
* Implement feature engineering, cross-validation, and model tuning for optimal performance and generalizability.
* Ensure model explainability and interpretability to translate insights into actionable recommendations.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Improve bank account access prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.
* Identify key factors driving financial inclusion and exclusion in each East African country.
* Inform targeted financial inclusion initiatives and product development strategies.
* Contribute to increased bank account access and financial well-being in the region.

**Target Audience:**

* Financial institutions operating in the region.
* Researchers and academics focused on financial inclusion.

**Next Steps:**

* Develop and refine the machine learning model.
* Analyze and interpret model findings.
* Disseminate insights and recommendations to policymakers and financial institutions.

**Join the Project:**
To join our impactful project on GitHub, you can choose one of two options:

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UDSM-AI/Bank-account-access-prediction.git
```

This command will create a local copy of the entire project repository on your system. Once completed, you can navigate into the newly created directory and start contributing!

**2. Fork the Repository and Contribute:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UDSM-AI/Bank-account-access-prediction.git my-fork-bank-account-access
cd my-fork-bank-account-access
git remote add upstream https://github.com/UDSM-AI/Bank-account-access-prediction.git
```

This approach creates a personal "fork" of the project where you can make changes and contributions without affecting the original repository. Once you're happy with your changes, you can create a pull request to share your work with the project maintainers for review and possible integration into the main repository.

**Getting Started with Contribution:**

* **Review the project documentation:** We'll have detailed documentation available within the repository itself, outlining contribution guidelines, coding standards, and specific areas where your skills are needed.
* **Choose your area of contribution:** Whether you're a data scientist, developer, or documentation expert, there are various ways to contribute. We encourage you to explore the codebase and identify areas where you can add value.
* **Communicate and collaborate:** Join our community through the project's GitHub discussions or dedicated communication channels to connect with other contributors and discuss ideas.

**Remember:**

* **Follow the contribution guidelines:** These will ensure your contributions are easily integrated and maintain a consistent codebase.
* **Test your changes:** Before submitting your work, ensure your code runs smoothly and adheres to the project's testing standards.
* **Be open to feedback:** We encourage constructive criticism and collaboration. All contributions will be reviewed carefully, and we'll work with you to improve your work before merging it into the main repository.

**Let's join forces to predict bank account access and foster financial inclusion in East Africa! We're excited to welcome you to the UDSM AI Team üê±‚Äçüèçüéâ!**
